# dmgbuild settings for the release DMG, read by Scripts/release.sh.
#
# dmgbuild writes the Finder layout (.DS_Store) itself, so the DMG gets its
# background and icon positions without scripting Finder. The AppleScript this
# replaces could not send Apple Events from every shell, and silently shipped
# 1.1.3 and 1.1.4 without a layout.
#
# Values come in through `-D`: app (the signed .app) and background (the PNG
# made by make-dmg-background.swift, 144 dpi so it fills the window on Retina).
